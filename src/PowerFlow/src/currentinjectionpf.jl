    currentinjectionpf(baseMVA, bus, gen, load, pvarray, Ybus, V0, ref, p, tol0, max_it0, alg="")

Solve power flow using the Current Injection method, particularly suitable for resistive networks.

# Arguments
- `baseMVA`: Base MVA for power system normalization
- `bus`: Matrix containing bus data
- `gen`: Matrix containing generator data
- `load`: Matrix containing load data
- `pvarray`: Array of PV bus information
- `Ybus`: Bus admittance matrix
- `V0`: Initial voltage vector
- `ref`: Reference (slack) bus index
- `p`: Array of PQ bus indices
- `tol0`: Convergence tolerance
- `max_it0`: Maximum number of iterations
- `alg`: Algorithm variant (optional)

# Returns
- `V`: Final complex voltage vector solution
- `converged`: Boolean indicating whether the algorithm converged
- `i`: Number of iterations performed

# Description
This function implements the Current Injection power flow method, which is particularly
effective for networks with high R/X ratios (resistive networks). The method works by:
1. Converting power injections to current injections
2. Calculating current mismatches
3. Solving for voltage updates using the real part of the admittance matrix
4. Iterating until convergence or maximum iterations reached
